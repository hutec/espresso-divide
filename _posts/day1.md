## Leaving Naples

After our 16h train ride, the start day was finally here. It was time to leave
dirty Naples behind and climb the Vesuvio Volcano. Naples traffic however is horrible
and didn't really make leaving enjoyable. Honking cars, scooters, endless streets with
nasty cobblestones. But soon we left the chaotic city life behind and moved towards more
rurals areas. It was time for the first Pizza stop. 10€ for 2 Pizzas, a giant bottle of
Coke and Water - we are ready for Italy and ready to tackle the climb to Vesuvio.

## Climbing Vesuvio and crossing the Valle de'll Inferno

We approach the Vesuvio from the west and start on a tarmac, but soon the gravel on
the distinct volcanic ash starts. Once the steep part is over, we enter the Valle de'll
Inferno and cross it.

Afterwards, we tried to get to the touristic point where one can peek inside the
volcanic crater, but some random guard said it costs 16.89€ and we were not ready
to pay that. The descent back to the flats was amazing and we had a beer halfway down.

## Searching for a camp spot

The day before we have picked a camping zone that we wanted to consider, but we found a
nice spot before we reached the planned destination. With a beautiful view over
Otaviano and Naples we cooked our first meal and got our first outdoor night.
